spike-land-ai is an AI-native development platform built across 15 independent repos — from a Next.js 16 main platform with 455+ MCP tools and Stripe-backed payments, to a from-scratch React Fiber implementation, edge transpilation workers, and a growing MCP ecosystem. It spans browser, edge (Cloudflare Workers), and server runtimes, all published under `@spike-land-ai` on GitHub Packages with automated dependency cascade CI.

## Quick Start

Each directory is a separate git repo. Clone the one you need:

```bash
# Main platform (Next.js 16)
git clone https://github.com/spike-land-ai/spike.land
cd spike.land
yarn install
yarn dev              # http://localhost:3000

# Node.js / MCP servers (most packages)
git clone https://github.com/spike-land-ai/<package>
cd <package>
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# Cloudflare Workers (spike-land-backend, transpile)
npm install
npm run dev           # local wrangler
npm run dev:remote    # remote wrangler

# Monaco editor (code)
npm install
npm run dev:vite      # Vite dev server

# Custom React (react-ts-worker)
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
```

Org-wide health check (PRs, CI status, dep drift):

```bash
make health
# or: bash .github/scripts/org-health.sh
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/ci-pipeline.svg" alt="CI/CD Pipeline" width="100%" />
</p>

All repos share a reusable workflow at `.github/.github/workflows/ci-publish.yml` running on Node 24. Changesets manages versioning; packages publish to GitHub Packages on every merge to `main`. spike.land uses its own extended pipeline: ESLint, TypeScript, Vitest (4 shards), Next.js build, then AWS ECS deploy via Depot remote builds.

## Dependency Cascade

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/dependency-flow.svg" alt="Dependency Cascade" width="100%" />
</p>

Publishing any `@spike-land-ai/*` package triggers automated PRs in downstream repos. The DAG is defined in `.github/dependency-map.json`. Check for drift locally:

```bash
bash .github/scripts/verify-deps.sh
```

| Source | Consumers |
|--------|-----------|
| `esbuild-wasm` | esbuild-wasm-mcp, code, transpile, spike-land-backend, spike.land |
| `shared` | code, transpile, spike-land-backend, spike.land |
| `react-ts-worker` | spike.land |
| `spike-cli` | spike.land |

## Development

```bash
# Node.js / MCP servers
npm run build         # Compile TypeScript
npm test              # Run Vitest tests
npm run test:coverage # Tests with coverage thresholds
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint          # ESLint

# spike.land (Yarn)
yarn dev              # Dev server (localhost:3000)
yarn build            # Production build
yarn typecheck        # TypeScript check
yarn test:coverage    # Vitest with enforced thresholds

# Cloudflare Workers
npm run dev           # Local wrangler dev
npm run w:deploy:prod # Deploy to production
```

## Contributing

- TypeScript strict mode is enforced across all packages — use `unknown` instead of `any`
- Tests are written with Vitest; coverage thresholds are enforced in CI (80%+ for most packages)
- Never use `eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-nocheck`
- Version and publish via [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) — do not manually bump `package.json` versions
- MCP servers follow the pattern: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + Zod schema + tool handler + matching test file
- spike.land uses Yarn; all other packages use npm
