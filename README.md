spike-land-ai is an AI-native development platform — a consolidated monorepo with 28 packages under `src/`. Powered by Cloudflare Workers + D1 as the data backbone, with a Vite + TanStack Router frontend, Hono edge services, and a growing MCP ecosystem of 80+ tools. It includes a from-scratch React Fiber implementation, edge transpilation workers, and spans browser, edge, and server runtimes, all published under `@spike-land-ai` on GitHub Packages with automated dependency cascade CI.

See [docs/](docs/README.md) for full documentation.

## Repository Deep Dive

### Platform Stack
- **spike-app**: Vite + React + TanStack Router frontend
- **spike-edge**: Primary edge API on Cloudflare Workers (Hono)
- **spike-land-mcp**: MCP registry with 80+ tools (CF Workers + D1)
- **mcp-auth**: Authentication service (Better Auth + Drizzle on CF Workers)

### AI & MCP Layer
We embrace the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as our primary integration interface. Repositories prefixed with `mcp-` or suffixed with `-mcp` provide specialized capabilities:
- **spike-land-mcp**: The tool registry (80+ tools).
- **mcp-image-studio**: The visual intelligence layer (Pixel Studio).
- **esbuild-wasm-mcp**: The builder layer.
- **hackernews-mcp**: Information retrieval layer.
- **mcp-server-base**: Shared utilities for building MCP servers.

### Infrastructure & Tooling
- **Dependency Cascade**: We use a custom automated system to propagate dependency updates across 28 packages, ensuring architectural consistency without manual toil.
- **Edge Computing**: We leverage Cloudflare Workers for ultra-low latency tasks like transpilation, MCP registry, auth, and real-time collaboration.
- **BAZDMEG Quality Gates**: Our automated review system (**spike-review**) ensures that every PR meets our rigorous engineering standards.


## Quick Start

All packages live under `src/`. Clone the repo and work from there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spike-land-ai/spike-land-ai
cd spike-land-ai

# Frontend SPA (Vite + TanStack Router)
cd src/spike-app
npm install
npm run dev

# Node.js / MCP servers (most packages)
cd src/<package>
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# Cloudflare Workers (spike-edge, spike-land-mcp, mcp-auth, spike-land-backend, transpile)
cd src/<worker>
npm install
npm run dev           # local wrangler
npm run dev:remote    # remote wrangler

# Monaco editor (code)
cd src/code
npm install
npm run dev:vite      # Vite dev server

# Custom React (react-ts-worker)
cd src/react-ts-worker
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
```

Org-wide health check (PRs, CI status, dep drift):

```bash
make health
# or: bash .github/scripts/org-health.sh
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spike-land-ai/.github/main/assets/ci-pipeline.svg" alt="CI/CD Pipeline" width="100%" />
</p>

All packages share a reusable workflow at `.github/.github/workflows/ci-publish.yml` running on Node 24. Changesets manages versioning; packages publish to GitHub Packages on every merge to `main`.

## Dependency Cascade

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spike-land-ai/.github/main/assets/dependency-flow.svg" alt="Dependency Cascade" width="100%" />
</p>

Publishing any `@spike-land-ai/*` package triggers automated PRs in downstream repos. The DAG is defined in `.github/dependency-map.json`. Check for drift locally:

```bash
bash .github/scripts/verify-deps.sh
```

## Development

```bash
# Node.js / MCP servers
npm run build         # Compile TypeScript
npm test              # Run Vitest tests
npm run test:coverage # Tests with coverage thresholds
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint          # ESLint

# spike-app (Vite frontend)
npm run dev           # Vite dev server
npm run build         # Production build

# Cloudflare Workers
npm run dev           # Local wrangler dev
npm run w:deploy:prod # Deploy to production
```

## Contributing

- TypeScript strict mode is enforced across all packages — use `unknown` instead of `any`
- Tests are written with Vitest; coverage thresholds are enforced in CI (80%+ for most packages)
- Never use `eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-nocheck`
- Version and publish via [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) — do not manually bump `package.json` versions
- MCP servers follow the pattern: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + Zod schema + tool handler + matching test file
