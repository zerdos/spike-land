## Category 1: BROKEN BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE (CRITICAL)

**Pattern**: 10 of 15 repos reference `@spike-land-ai/tsconfig` and `@spike-land-ai/eslint-config` as devDependencies, but these packages are NOT installed/resolvable, causing complete build/test/lint failures.

| Repo | tsconfig broken | eslint-config broken | Tests run? |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| spike-land-backend | X | X | NO (22 failed suites) |
| transpile | X | X | NO |
| shared | X | - | NO |
| spike-cli | X | X | NO (30 test files, 0 tests) |
| openclaw-mcp | X | X | NO |
| spike-review | X | X | NO |
| vibe-dev | X | X | NO |
| esbuild-wasm-mcp | X | - | NO |
| code | - | X | Partial |
| video | - | X | NO (missing @testing-library/*) |
| hackernews-mcp | OK | OK | YES |
| mcp-nanobanana | OK | OK | YES |
| react-ts-worker | OK | - | YES (but 0 test files exist) |
| esbuild-wasm | N/A | N/A | N/A (no scripts) |
| spike.land | OK | OK | YES |

**Root cause**: The shared config packages in `.github/packages/` are published via `ci-configs.yml` but aren't properly installed in consuming repos.

**Files**:
- `.github/packages/tsconfig/` — source of `@spike-land-ai/tsconfig`
- `.github/packages/eslint-config/` — source of `@spike-land-ai/eslint-config`
- Each repo's `tsconfig.json` line 2 and `eslint.config.mjs` line 1
