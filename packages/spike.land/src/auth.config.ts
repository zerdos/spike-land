/**
 * Better Auth Configuration (Edge-compatible config parts)

 * This file contains the stable ID logic previously used by NextAuth.

/**
 * Creates a stable user ID based on email address.
 * This ensures the same user gets the same ID regardless of OAuth provider.
 * Uses a simple hash for Edge runtime compatibility.
 *
 * Uses USER_ID_SALT (preferred) or falls back to AUTH_SECRET.
 * USER_ID_SALT should never be rotated as it would change all user IDs.
 * Using a dedicated salt allows AUTH_SECRET to be rotated for security.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: User IDs are tied to email addresses. If a user changes their
 * email address (at the OAuth provider level), they will get a new user ID
 * and lose access to their previous data. This is by design to maintain
 * the 1:1 relationship between email and user identity.
