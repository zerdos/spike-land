## 1. Pipeline Timing: Commit to Production

### Workflows triggered on every push to main

| Workflow                | Avg Duration   | Range         | Success Rate              |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **CI/CD Pipeline**      | 3.1 min        | 2.1 - 5.4 min | 20% (4/20)                |
| **Deploy to AWS ECS**   | 1.7 min        | 0.7 - 10 min  | 0% (0/18)                 |
| **Deploy Hono MCP API** | 2.9 min        | 2.6 - 4.2 min | 0% (0/8)                  |
| **Claude Code Review**  | skipped        | -             | Triggers after CI success |
| **CodeQL**              | scheduled only | -             | Fridays 5:28 AM UTC       |

### CI/CD Pipeline Breakdown (successful run #22174827154)

| Job                              | Duration         | Notes                       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |

**CI total: ~5.5 min** (wall clock, parallel jobs)

### Full Production Deploy Pipeline (when working)

| Stage                            | Optimistic  | Pessimistic | Notes                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| CI/CD Pipeline                   | 3 min       | 5.5 min     | Parallel: lint + 4 test shards     |
| Claude Code Review               | 2 min       | 5 min       | Auto-approve or request changes    |
| Docker Build (workerd + Next.js) | 5 min       | 25 min      | Parallel; cached vs cold           |
| Deploy us-east-1 (canary)        | 5 min       | 16 min      | ECS rolling + 8 min stability wait |
| Smoke tests us-east-1            | 1 min       | 5 min       | Health checks + API tests          |
| ECR cross-region replication     | 2 min       | 5 min       | us-east-1 -> eu-west-1             |
| Deploy eu-west-1                 | 5 min       | 16 min      | Same as us-east-1                  |

| **TOTAL**                        | **~24 min** | **~82 min** | Commit to fully deployed globally  |

**Warning:** Both ECS deploy workflows and Hono API deploy are ALL FAILING (0%
success rate). Production deploys are not completing.

## 2. CI/CD Costs

### GitHub Actions (FREE)

- **Repo is public** - all Actions minutes are **free and unlimited**
- Current volume: **~396 workflow runs/day**, projected **~11,000 runs/month**
- Cache usage: 10.2 GB (14 active caches)
- **Cost: $0/month**

### Compute Time Consumed (free due to public repo)

| Workflow                 | Runs/month (est.) | Avg min/run (total jobs) | Total minutes         |

## 5. Key Observations

### Pipeline Health Warning

- **CI success rate: only 20%** (4/20 recent runs on main)
- **ECS deploy: 0% success** (all 18 recent runs failed)
- **Hono API deploy: 0% success** (all 8 recent runs failed)
- ~40 commits/day to main but only ~8 pass CI

### Cost Efficiency Wins

- **Public repo = free CI** (saves ~$160-320/month)
- **Trunk-based development** avoids branch/PR overhead
- **Smart test sharding** (4x parallel) keeps CI under 6 min
- **`--changed HEAD^1`** on main runs only affected tests

### Cost Risks

- AWS ECS is the biggest cost driver (~68% of optimistic total)
- Two-region deployment doubles compute costs
- 11 Vercel cron jobs (4 running every 15 min) may push past included limits
- ~11,000 workflow runs/month is very high (could hit cache/storage limits)

## Verification

This analysis is based on:

- `gh run list` data from Feb 16-19, 2026 (1000 runs)
- `gh run view` job-level timing for successful run #22174827154
- Workflow YAML files in `.github/workflows/`
- Infrastructure config files (`vercel.json`, `wrangler.toml`, Prisma schema)
- Repo is **public** (confirmed via API) = free Actions
