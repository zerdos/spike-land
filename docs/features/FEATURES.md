# spike.land — Features

## Platform overview

spike.land is a workspace platform where AI agents build, deploy, and manage
full-stack applications. Each workspace is personalized based on a 4-question
onboarding flow (16 personas). The platform exposes all business logic as MCP
tools — 455+ tools across 15+ categories.

## Core features

### Personalized workspaces

4 binary onboarding questions produce 16 personas. Each persona maps to a
different set of recommended apps, homepage layout, and hero copy. Workspaces
diverge further over time as users build tools, install apps, and configure
themes.

- **Source**: `src/lib/onboarding/personas.ts`, `src/app/onboarding/`
- **Question flow**: Code? → Solo/Team → Learning/Shipping → specific persona
- **Non-dev branch**: Business/Personal → Solo/Team → specific persona

### Tool Factory (self-extending agent)

Agents register custom HTTP proxy tools scoped to a workspace at runtime. Tool
handlers are declarative specs (URL, method, headers, body template) — no
arbitrary code execution.

- **Source**: `src/lib/mcp/server/tools/tool-factory.ts`
- **Security**: HTTPS-only, SSRF prevention (private IP blocking), template
  variable validation (`{{secrets.KEY}}`, `{{input.FIELD}}` only)
- **Limits**: 5 tools (free), 500 tools (premium)

### A/B testing engine

z-test with pooled proportions. 95% confidence threshold. Runs on prompts, UI
layouts, app configurations, and MCP tool outputs.

- **Source**: `src/lib/mcp/server/tools/ab-testing.ts`,
  `src/lib/mcp/server/tools/store-ab.ts`
- **Tools**: create test, get results, check significance, declare winner, list
  active tests

### Page AI (frontend generation)

5 MCP tools that generate complete pages from text prompts.

- **Source**: `src/lib/mcp/server/tools/page-ai.ts`
- **Tools**: generate page, enhance block, suggest layout, generate theme,
  populate store
- **Layouts**: Landing, Feature, Store, Dashboard, Article, Gallery, Custom
- **Themes**: Modern, Minimal, Bold, Playful

### White-label theming

CSS custom properties generated from workspace config. Tailwind-compatible.
Runtime theme objects for React.

- **Source**: `src/lib/white-label/theme-builder.ts`
- **Features**: Primary/secondary/accent colors, custom fonts, logo/favicon,
  "powered by" toggle, alpha channel support

## spike-cli

A model-agnostic coding agent and MCP multiplexer CLI.

- **Package**: `@spike-land-ai/spike-cli` (external repo)
- **Install**: `npx @spike-land-ai/spike-cli`
- **Transport**: stdio, SSE, HTTP

### Commands

| Command                                | Description                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `spike serve [options]`                | Start MCP multiplexer server (stdio by default)      |
| `spike shell [options]`                | Interactive REPL to explore and call MCP tools       |

| `spike status`                         | Health check for configured MCP servers              |

### MCP Multiplexer

Aggregates multiple MCP servers into a single interface with namespace
isolation, lazy toolset loading, and automatic reconnection with exponential
backoff. Works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, etc.).

#### Why Lazy Toolset Loading

AI agents work best with small, relevant tool lists. An LLM presented with
hundreds of tool definitions wastes context parsing tools it will never use.
spike-cli groups tools into named toolsets that load on demand — only gateway
tools are visible by default. The agent requests a toolset when needed, keeping
the context window focused on signal. Result: better decisions, lower token
cost.

- **Components**: `multiplexer-server.ts`, `namespace.ts`, `reconnect.ts`,
  `server-manager.ts`, `toolset-manager.ts`, `upstream-client.ts`

## App Store

18 store app listings (19 first-party app directories) across 6 categories at
[spike.land/store](https://spike.land/store). Each workspace gets different app
recommendations based on onboarding persona. 46 Storybook pages provide visual
documentation for app components.
