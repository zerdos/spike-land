# Launch Plan - Spike Land Platform

**Target Launch Date:** TBD (Recommended: Q1 2026) **Platform:**
https://spike.land **Version:** 1.0.0

This document outlines the comprehensive launch strategy, timeline, monitoring
plan, rollback procedures, and support escalation paths for the Spike Land
platform.

---

## 🎯 Launch Strategy

### Launch Approach: Phased Rollout

We recommend a **phased rollout** strategy to minimize risk and ensure platform
stability:

1. **Private Beta** (T-14 to T-7): Internal testing with team and invited users
2. **Public Beta** (T-7 to T-1): Limited public access with invitation codes
3. **Soft Launch** (T-Day): Full public access with minimal marketing
4. **Full Launch** (T+7): Full marketing push and public announcement

### Launch Goals

#### Primary Goals

- Achieve 99.9% uptime in first 30 days
- Process 1,000+ MCP tool calls without critical failures
- Onboard 50+ developers successfully
- Zero critical security incidents

#### Secondary Goals

- Average API response time < 500ms (p95)
- MCP tool call success rate > 95%
- User retention > 60% (returning within 7 days)
- Positive user feedback (NPS > 40)
- Publish spike-cli (`@spike-land-ai/spike-cli`) to npm registry
- Submit spike-cli to MCP registry listings (Smithery, mcp.run, Glama)
- Validate that all 533+ MCP tools (147 tool files, 150 test files) are
  accessible via both web dashboard and spike-cli CLI

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

**Immediate Rollback Triggers:**

- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Data integrity issue detected (data loss or corruption)
- Complete service outage > 15 minutes
- Error rate > 50% for > 5 minutes
- Payment processing failures affecting users

**Evaluate Rollback:**

- Error rate > 10% for > 15 minutes
- Tool call failure rate > 50%
- Significant performance degradation
- Multiple critical bugs reported

### Rollback Process

#### Emergency Rollback (< 5 Minutes)

**Option 1: Revert to Previous Deployment (Fastest)**

```bash
# Via Cloudflare — rollback to previous Worker version
wrangler rollback --name spike-edge
wrangler rollback --name spike-land-mcp
# Verify production URL loads successfully
```

**Option 2: Rollback via Git**

```bash
# Revert commit and push to trigger new deployment
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

#### Database Rollback (If Needed)

**WARNING:** Only if migration caused the issue

```bash
# Step 1: Check D1 database state
wrangler d1 execute spike-land-mcp-db --command 'SELECT * FROM drizzle_migrations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;'

# Step 2: Apply reverse migration if needed
# D1 migrations are managed via Drizzle — create and apply a rollback migration

# Step 3: Verify database state
wrangler d1 execute spike-land-mcp-db --command 'SELECT count(*) FROM users;'
```

**IMPORTANT:** Database rollbacks are risky. Prefer rolling forward with fixes.

### Post-Rollback Actions

**Immediately After Rollback:**

1. [ ] Verify production is stable
2. [ ] Notify team in Slack
3. [ ] Post status update (if public-facing)
4. [ ] Begin incident post-mortem

**Within 1 Hour:**

1. [ ] Document what went wrong
2. [ ] Identify root cause
3. [ ] Create hotfix plan
4. [ ] Test hotfix in staging

**Within 4 Hours:**

1. [ ] Deploy tested hotfix
2. [ ] Verify fix resolves issue
3. [ ] Complete incident report
4. [ ] Update documentation

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Severity | Error Rate | Affected Users | Action                                | Timeline  |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Critical | > 50%      | All            | Immediate rollback                    | < 5 min   |
| High     | > 25%      | > 50%          | Evaluate → Likely rollback            | < 15 min  |
| Medium   | > 10%      | > 25%          | Investigate → Fix forward if possible | < 1 hour  |
| Low      | > 5%       | < 10%          | Fix forward                           | < 4 hours |
