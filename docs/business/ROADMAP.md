## Vision: The Open MCP App Store With Managed Runtime

**Spike Land is an open MCP app store where developers vibe code full-stack
apps, publish them, and run them across edge-hosted, cross-origin, and offline
surfaces -- powered by Spike, your personalized AI assistant with 533+ tools
accessible via CLI, web chat, WhatsApp, and Telegram.**

spike-cli lets you build, deploy, and manage applications from the command line.
The web platform provides a visual dashboard. Every capability is exposed as an
MCP tool. Every workflow can be automated by AI agents through the Model Context
Protocol.

**The moat is three things no competitor has together:**

1. **MCP-native architecture with multi-channel access** - 533+ tools callable
   by any AI agent via standard protocol, accessible through spike-cli (CLI),
   web chat, WhatsApp, and Telegram. No competitor offers this breadth of access
   channels.
2. **Open app-store distribution with vibe coding** - Build full-stack apps
   with AI assistance, publish them into the catalog, and distribute them as
   callable MCP software.
3. **UK Ltd with Stripe-first billing** - Global payments, VAT handling,
   SEIS/EIS eligible

**Positioning**: Open MCP app store with managed runtime **Core Product**:
spike-cli (MCP multiplexer CLI), Spike web chat, WhatsApp & Telegram bots
**Supporting Tools**: App Store, vibe coding, real-time code editor, offline
bundling, Cloudflare deployment guides **Target Market**: Developers, AI agent
builders, solo founders, small teams

## Monetization Strategy

### Tier 1: Platform Subscriptions (Commercial Launch)

Public beta access is live. Paid subscriptions and recurring billing activate at commercial launch.

| Tier     | Price | Deployments | AI Credits/mo | Team Members |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| FREE     | $0    | 3           | 100           | 1            |
| PRO      | $29   | 10          | 1,000         | 3            |
| BUSINESS | $99   | Unlimited   | 5,000         | 10           |

### Tier 2: MCP API Access (Q1-Q2 2026) - THE DIFFERENTIATOR

No competitor offers this. Package the MCP server as a paid API product for AI
agents.

| Access Level         | Price    | API Calls/mo | Capabilities                   |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Included in BUSINESS | $0 extra | 1,000        | Read-only (reports, analytics) |
| API PRO add-on       | $49/mo   | 10,000       | Full read/write                |
| API SCALE add-on     | $149/mo  | 100,000      | Webhooks, batch operations     |

**Call weighting**: Read = 1 call, Write = 5, AI operation = 10, Batch = 25

### Tier 3: Tool Marketplace (Q2-Q3 2026)

Third-party developers can publish MCP tools to the Spike registry. Revenue
share: 70% developer / 30% platform.

### Tier 4: Unified Credit Economy (Ongoing)

Merge all credits into "Spike Credits":

| Tier     | Included Credits | Overage Rate  |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| FREE     | 100              | N/A           |
| PRO      | 1,000            | $0.008/credit |
| BUSINESS | 5,000            | $0.006/credit |

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Credit utilization rate** by tier (hitting limits? too much headroom?)
- **Overage conversion rate** (% who hit limits and buy more vs. churn)
- **MCP API adoption rate** (% of BUSINESS users enabling API access)
- **Multi-channel usage** (% of users engaging via WhatsApp/Telegram vs. web)
- **Tool marketplace submissions** (third-party developer engagement)
- **Net Revenue Retention** (target: >110%)

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor     | Price    | MCP?    | CLI?                | Multi-Channel?               | Our Advantage             |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Vercel         | $20+/mo  | No      | Yes                 | No                           | MCP-native + AI assistant |
| Railway        | $5+/mo   | No      | Yes                 | No                           | 533+ tools + vibe coding  |
| Render         | $7+/mo   | No      | Yes                 | No                           | AI-first deployment       |
| Replit         | $25+/mo  | No      | No                  | No                           | MCP registry + CLI        |
| **Spike Land** | $0-99/mo | **Yes** | **Yes (spike-cli)** | **Yes (WhatsApp, Telegram)** | Full platform             |

**No deployment platform offers a programmable AI agent with 533+ MCP tools
accessible via CLI, web, WhatsApp, and Telegram.** This is the differentiator.
