## Vision: The Open MCP App Store With Managed Runtime

**Spike Land is an open MCP app store where developers vibe code full-stack
apps, publish them, and run them across edge-hosted, cross-origin, and offline
surfaces -- powered by Spike, your personalized AI assistant with 533+ tools
accessible today via CLI and web chat, with WhatsApp in beta and Telegram
planned.**

spike-cli lets you build, deploy, and manage applications from the command line.
The web platform provides a visual dashboard. Every capability is exposed as an
MCP tool. Every workflow can be automated by AI agents through the Model Context
Protocol.

Apps are organized into categories for discovery, but they are not limited to a
single frontend. The same app can increasingly be expressed through multiple
surfaces: browser UI, CLI, chat, embedded cross-origin views, and local/offline
bundles. One path under active development is a typed-to-MDX rendering model
where strong TypeScript tool contracts can be turned programmatically into
session-aware frontend surfaces.

The platform is also being built as a feedback system rather than a one-shot
generator:

`intent -> select tools/skills -> generate -> transpile -> render -> review -> observe -> improve`

That loop matters because the more the platform is used, the more traces,
feedback, and failure data it can use to improve the next run.

The core equation is simple:

`Spike Land = tools + agents`

The moat is not the tools alone, and it is not the agents alone. The strength
comes from running high-quality tools and agents in the same observable loop,
then using that loop to improve spike.land itself.

**The moat is four things no competitor has together:**

1. **MCP-native architecture with multi-channel access** - 533+ tools callable
   by any AI agent via standard protocol, accessible through spike-cli (CLI),
   web chat, and an in-progress channel expansion that already includes
   WhatsApp building blocks. No competitor offers this breadth of access
   channels.
2. **Open app-store distribution with multi-surface apps** - Build full-stack
   apps with AI assistance, publish them into the catalog, and distribute them
   as callable MCP software with more than one frontend over time.
3. **Feedback-driven self-improvement loop** - Generation, transpilation,
   rendering, review, observability, and prompt/skill improvement are designed
   as one system rather than separate tools.
4. **Quality tools + intelligent agents** - QA, review, browser automation,
   deployment, and bug-detection tools are used by agents inside the platform
   itself, including ELO-guided prioritization and remediation loops.
5. **UK Ltd with Stripe-first billing** - Global payments, VAT handling,
   SEIS/EIS eligible

**Positioning**: Open MCP app store with managed runtime **Core Product**:
spike-cli (MCP multiplexer CLI), Spike web chat, WhatsApp beta integration, and
Telegram on the roadmap
**Supporting Tools**: App Store, vibe coding, real-time code editor,
feedback-driven QA/review, offline bundling, Cloudflare deployment guides
**Target Market**: Developers, AI agent builders, solo founders, small teams

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: spike-app (Vite + React + TanStack Router)
- **Edge API**: spike-edge, spike-land-mcp, mcp-auth (Cloudflare Workers + Hono)
- **Database**: D1 (SQLite at edge) + Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Better Auth (sessions, OAuth, device flow)
- **AI**: Google Gemini (gemini-3-flash), Anthropic Claude (Agent SDK)
- **Testing**: Vitest 4.0 (80% line/function coverage enforced in CI)
- **Payments**: Stripe | **Email**: Resend
- **Infra**: Cloudflare Workers (8 total) — zero AWS

### Scale

- 29 packages in `src/` (monorepo)
- 8 Cloudflare Workers (spike-edge, spike-land-mcp, mcp-auth, spike-land-backend, transpile, code, spike-review, image-studio-worker)
- 533+ MCP tools (86 native + multiplexer ecosystem)
- D1 database with 17 tables in spike-land-mcp (Drizzle-managed)
- block-sdk for composable storage blocks

### Platform Characteristics

- **Apps are callable products**: not just pages, but typed tool surfaces that
  can be expressed through multiple frontends.
- **Command plane over UI-only flows**: `/create`, `/test`, `/deploy`, and
  `/vibe-code` are the intended control-plane verbs across cloud and local
  execution paths.
- **Feedback is first-class**: tool calls, failures, review output, and user
  reports are part of the product loop rather than post-hoc instrumentation.
- **Experimentation is also a quality system**: A/B testing, variant error
  tracking, and anomaly detection are treated as reliability inputs, not just
  growth tooling.
- **Observability compounds quality**: as usage grows, the platform should gain
  better traces, better skill routing, and better next-run performance.
- **Tools and agents reinforce each other**: the platform's QA, review, deploy,
  and bug-detection tools are used by agents to improve the platform itself.

- **Overage conversion rate** (% who hit limits and buy more vs. churn)
- **MCP API adoption rate** (% of BUSINESS users enabling API access)
- **Multi-channel usage** (% of users engaging via WhatsApp/Telegram vs. web)
- **Time-to-running-app** (golden-path intent -> deployed surface time)
- **Feedback-loop lift** (success rate improvement after review/repair cycle)
- **Tool-call observability coverage** (% of important tool paths traced/reviewable)
- **Tool marketplace submissions** (third-party developer engagement)
- **Net Revenue Retention** (target: >110%)

| Render         | $7+/mo   | No      | Yes                 | No                           | AI-first deployment       |
| Replit         | $25+/mo  | No      | No                  | No                           | MCP registry + CLI        |
| **Spike Land** | $0-99/mo | **Yes** | **Yes (spike-cli)** | **Partial (web, CLI, WhatsApp beta)** | Full platform + self-improving loop |

**No deployment platform offers a programmable AI agent with 533+ MCP tools,
multi-surface apps, and a feedback-driven loop already accessible via CLI and
web, with WhatsApp in beta and further channels on the roadmap.** This is the
differentiator.
