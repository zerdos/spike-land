## Valuation Methods

### 1. SaaS Revenue Multiple Analysis

The SaaS revenue multiple approach values SPIKE LAND based on projected Annual
Recurring Revenue (ARR) benchmarked against comparable social media management
platforms. This method reflects market sentiment toward recurring revenue
businesses but requires significant discount factors due to the company's
pre-revenue stage.

#### Comparable Company Benchmarks

| Company             | Stage           | ARR Multiple | Notes                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Sprout Social**   | Public          | 8-10x        | Enterprise-focused, $350M+ ARR               |
| **HubSpot**         | Public          | 12-15x       | Multi-product platform, $2B+ ARR             |
| **Later**           | Acquired (2022) | 5-7x         | SMB Instagram scheduler, ~$30M ARR at exit   |
| **Buffer**          | Private         | 4-6x         | Established SMB tool, transparent financials |
| **SMB SaaS Median** | —               | 6-8x         | Industry benchmark for mature companies      |

#### Stage-Adjusted Multiples

Given SPIKE LAND's pre-revenue status, we apply a **70% discount** to mature
SaaS multiples to account for execution risk, customer acquisition uncertainty,
and lack of proven retention metrics. This yields a working range of **1.8x -
3.0x ARR** for valuation purposes.

| Y3 ARR | £7.87M ($10.0M) | 2.5x     | **£19.7M**      | **$25.0M**      |

#### Key Assumptions & Limitations

- Multiples derived from public comps with proven business models; SPIKE LAND's
  multi-channel strategy (web dashboard + spike-cli + App Store + MCP API) may
  command premium once validated
- The dual-interface approach (GUI + CLI) widens addressable market beyond
  traditional social media SaaS
- **Confidence Level: LOW-MEDIUM** — forward-looking revenue multiples are
  highly sensitive to actual go-to-market execution

### 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Method:** Five-year free cash flow projection with terminal value calculated
using Gordon Growth Model. The analysis assumes 85% gross margin (typical for
SaaS platforms), declining operating expense ratios as the business scales, and
a 30-40% WACC reflecting early-stage technology venture risk.

#### Realistic Scenario — 5-Year Free Cash Flow Projection

| Year | Revenue         | Gross Profit (85%) | OpEx (% Rev) | FCF Margin | Free Cash Flow | Discount Factor (35%) | PV of FCF |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- | -------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 2026 | £78.7K ($100K)  | £66.9K ($85K)      | 120%         | -35%       | -£27.6K        | 0.741                 | -£20.4K   |
| 2027 | £1.18M ($1.50M) | £1.00M ($1.28M)    | 65%          | -20%       | -£236K         | 0.549                 | -£129K    |
| 2028 | £4.72M ($6.00M) | £4.01M ($5.10M)    | 50%          | 15%        | £708K          | 0.406                 | £288K     |
| 2029 | £9.45M ($12.0M) | £8.03M ($10.2M)    | 45%          | 25%        | £2.36M         | 0.301                 | £711K     |
| 2030 | £15.7M ($20.0M) | £13.4M ($17.0M)    | 42%          | 35%        | £5.51M         | 0.223                 | £1.23M    |

#### Terminal Value Calculation (Gordon Growth Model)

- Year 5 FCF: £5.51M ($7.0M)
- Terminal growth rate: 4%
- Terminal value = FCF5 x (1 + g) / (WACC - g) = £5.51M x 1.04 / (0.35 - 0.04) =
  **£18.5M ($23.5M)**
- PV of terminal value = £18.5M x 0.223 = **£4.12M ($5.23M)**

#### Enterprise Value by Scenario

| Scenario        | Revenue Assumptions           | WACC | Enterprise Value (GBP) | Enterprise Value (USD) |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Pessimistic** | Y1: $40K, Y3: $1.5M, Y5: $4M  | 40%  | £3.5M — £5.8M          | $4.4M — $7.4M          |
| **Realistic**   | Y1: $100K, Y3: $6M, Y5: $20M  | 35%  | £6.1M — £10.2M         | $7.8M — $13.0M         |
| **Optimistic**  | Y1: $150K, Y3: $10M, Y5: $30M | 30%  | £9.8M — £16.5M         | $12.4M — $21.0M        |

#### Sensitivity to WACC (Realistic Scenario)

| WACC | Enterprise Value (GBP) | Enterprise Value (USD) |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 30%  | £10.2M                 | $13.0M                 |
| 35%  | £7.78M                 | $9.88M                 |
| 40%  | £6.12M                 | $7.77M                 |

**Confidence Level:** LOW. DCF valuation at pre-revenue stage is highly
sensitive to growth assumptions, profitability timelines, and discount rate
selection. The pessimistic scenario reduces the terminal value substantially,
while the optimistic scenario's spike-cli-fuelled developer funnel accelerates
cash flows forward. This method should be triangulated with asset-based and
market-based approaches.

---

### 3. Venture Capital Method

The Venture Capital Method works backwards from projected exit values through
expected dilution to determine current pre-money valuation. This approach
reflects how institutional investors price early-stage deals based on target
returns (20-30x for pre-seed/seed rounds).

#### Exit Value Projections (Year 5-7)

| Scenario        | Y5-7 ARR | Exit Multiple | Exit Value (GBP) | Exit Value (USD) |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **Pessimistic** | $4-5M    | 5x            | £16-20M          | $20-25M          |
| **Realistic**   | $20-25M  | 8x            | £126-157M        | $160-200M        |
| **Optimistic**  | $30-35M  | 12x           | £283-331M        | $360-420M        |

_Exit multiples based on social media SaaS M&A comps (Later acquired ~5-7x ARR,
Hootsuite valued ~12x ARR). Optimistic scenario reflects spike-cli creating an
additional developer-tools exit premium._

#### Dilution Schedule

| Round       | Timing  | Dilution | Cumulative Ownership |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| **Current** | 2026    | 0%       | 100%                 |
| Seed        | 2026-27 | 18%      | 82%                  |
| Series A    | 2028    | 22%      | 64%                  |
| Series B    | 2030    | 18%      | 52%                  |

**Founders' exit ownership:** 52% of exit value

#### Implied Pre-Money Valuation

| Scenario        | Exit Value (GBP) | Founder Share | Target Return | **Implied Pre-Money** |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| **Pessimistic** | £18M             | £9.4M         | 5x            | **£1.9M** ($2.4M)     |
| **Realistic**   | £142M            | £74M          | 20x           | **£3.7M** ($4.7M)     |
| **Optimistic**  | £307M            | £160M         | 25x           | **£6.4M** ($8.1M)     |

spike-cli adds materially to the exit value story: a multi-channel platform
appeals to both strategic acquirers seeking developer ecosystems and financial
buyers valuing multiple revenue vectors. No comparable deployment platform exit
has included an MCP-native CLI/agent interface, creating potential for premium
acquisition multiples.

#### SEIS/EIS Adjusted Pricing

UK investors benefit from 50% income tax relief (SEIS) + capital gains
exemption, effectively reducing their cost basis by ~50-60%. This supports
premium valuations:

- **Market rate pre-money:** £3.7M — £5.5M
- **SEIS/EIS-adjusted effective cost:** £1.9M — £2.8M
- **Investor IRR equivalent:** 35-40% (vs. 25x target)

**Recommended valuation: £4.0M — £6.0M pre-money** balances VC return
requirements with SEIS/EIS benefits while leaving room for milestone-based
upward revision post-launch.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM. Standard VC pricing methodology well-suited for
this stage. The pessimistic scenario reflects acqui-hire/IP-sale exits; the
optimistic scenario reflects spike-cli creating a developer-ecosystem premium.

### 4. Berkus Method

The Berkus Method evaluates pre-revenue startups across five dimensions, each
worth up to $500K (£394K), for a maximum $2.5M (£1.97M) pre-money valuation.
This approach is particularly well-suited for SPIKE LAND's current pre-revenue
stage.

#### Key Findings

**Strengths:** Exceptional technical execution (maximum prototype score across
all scenarios). The dual-interface architecture (web dashboard + spike-cli)
boosts Sound Idea and Strategic Relationships scores — no competitor offers both
a GUI dashboard and a CLI multiplexer for the same toolset.

**Weaknesses:** Pre-revenue status, solo founder dependency, unproven GTM
execution. The realistic valuation of £1.2M reflects strong technology
offsetting commercialization risk.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. Berkus Method designed for this exact stage;
spike-cli's 46-file codebase with multiplexer architecture, auth system, and
interactive shell adds tangible prototype value that would not have existed in a
single-product analysis.

### 5. Scorecard Method

The Scorecard Method compares SPIKE LAND LTD against the median UK seed-stage
SaaS valuation of **£3.0M** ($3.8M) using seven weighted factors to derive an
adjustment multiplier.

#### Factor Assessment by Scenario

| Factor                      | Weight | Pessimistic | Realistic | Optimistic | Rationale                                                                                                                                    |

| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Pessimistic** | 0.88x                | £2.63M          | $3.34M          |
| **Realistic**   | 1.12x                | £3.36M          | $4.27M          |
| **Optimistic**  | 1.31x                | £3.94M          | $5.00M          |

**Range (each +/-10%):** Pessimistic £2.37M — £2.89M; Realistic £3.02M — £3.70M;
Optimistic £3.55M — £4.33M

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM. The dual-interface architecture (web dashboard +
spike-cli) strengthens Product/Technology and Competitive Environment scores
beyond what a single-product deployment platform would achieve.

### 6. Cost-to-Replicate Analysis

The cost-to-replicate method values SPIKE LAND LTD by calculating the
engineering investment required to rebuild the platform from scratch. This
provides a tangible, asset-based valuation floor grounded in verifiable codebase
metrics. With the addition of spike-cli, the replacement cost increases
materially.

#### Overhead & Infrastructure

| Category                         | % of Dev Cost | Traditional       | AI-Assisted       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Architecture & Planning**      | 15-20%        | £0.9M - £2.5M     | £0.6M - £1.5M     |
| **Testing & QA** (100% coverage) | 20-25%        | £1.3M - £3.1M     | £0.8M - £1.8M     |
| **DevOps & CI/CD**               | 10-15%        | £0.6M - £1.8M     | £0.4M - £1.1M     |

| **Subtotal (Overhead)**          | 60-75%        | **£3.7M - £9.2M** | **£2.4M - £5.5M** |

#### Additional Costs

| Item                       | Cost (GBP)    | Cost (USD)     | Justification                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure Setup**   | £150K - £250K | $190K - $318K  | Vercel, Cloudflare, Postgres, Redis, monitoring           |
| **Domain & Brand**         | £50K - £100K  | $64K - $127K   | Domain premium, trademark, brand identity                 |
| **npm Package & Registry** | £25K - £50K   | $32K - $64K    | spike-cli npm publishing, registry listings, distribution |
| **Opportunity Cost**       | £500K - £1M   | $635K - $1.27M | 12-18 months founder time, domain expertise               |

#### Final Cost Range

| Scenario                                | Development    | Overhead      | Infrastructure | Total (GBP)         | Total (USD)         |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Traditional Development**             | £6.3M - £12.3M | £3.7M - £9.2M | £0.7M - £1.4M  | **£10.7M - £22.9M** | **$13.6M - $29.1M** |
| **AI-Assisted** (40% productivity gain) | £3.8M - £7.4M  | £2.4M - £5.5M | £0.7M - £1.4M  | **£6.9M - £14.3M**  | **$8.8M - $18.2M**  |

**Conservative Floor Valuation: £6.9M — £11.0M ($8.8M — $14.0M)**

This range reflects the tangible replacement cost of the platform's 953K lines
of production-quality TypeScript (up from 944K with spike-cli), 233-model
database schema, 147 MCP tools with 150 test files, and 9-package monorepo
architecture including the spike-cli multiplexer. The spike-cli addition
contributes approximately **£170K — £340K** in direct development cost, but its
architectural value (multiplexer design, server discovery, namespace isolation)
is worth substantially more in the context of the platform's dual-interface
strategy.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. Based on verifiable, tangible assets with
industry-standard cost benchmarks. spike-cli costs are additive and
independently verifiable.

### 7. Comparable Transactions Analysis

The Comparable Transactions method values spike.land by analysing recent M&A
activity in the social media management and marketing SaaS sector. This approach
derives implied valuation multiples from actual transaction prices, then applies
them with appropriate stage-based adjustments.

#### Recent Comparable Transactions

| Company    | Acquirer/Event | Year | Transaction Value    | ARR      | Implied Multiple |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---- | -------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Later      | Mavrck         | 2022 | ~£200M ($254M)       | ~$38-51M | ~5-7x ARR        |
| Sprinklr   | IPO            | 2021 | ~£4B ($5.1B)         | ~$635M   | ~8x ARR          |
| Khoros     | Vista Equity   | 2021 | ~£1B ($1.3B)         | ~$191M   | ~6-7x ARR        |
| Brandwatch | Cision         | 2021 | ~£450M ($572M)       | ~$102M   | ~5-6x ARR        |
| Falcon.io  | Cision         | 2019 | ~£150M ($191M)       | ~$38M    | ~5x ARR          |
| Hootsuite  | Private (peak) | 2021 | ~£4B ($5.1B)         | ~$254M   | ~20x ARR         |
| Buffer     | Private (est.) | 2023 | ~£70-100M ($89-127M) | ~$25M    | ~4-5x ARR        |

**Median Multiple:** ~6x ARR (excluding Hootsuite's outlier 20x peak valuation)

**Notable absence:** No comparable transaction involves a platform with both a
GUI dashboard AND a CLI/agent interface. This is a structural gap in the comp
set — spike.land's dual-interface architecture has no direct precedent, which
could support premium multiples if validated by traction.

#### Stage Discount Justification

SPIKE LAND is **pre-revenue** whereas all comparables had substantial ARR
($25M-$635M). Standard venture valuation practice applies the following
discounts:

- **Execution risk:** -60% (no proven revenue model vs. established sales
  machines)
- **Scale risk:** -70% (single founder vs. teams of 50-500+)
- **Market risk:** -50% (unproven product-market fit vs. thousands of paying
  customers)
- **Liquidity risk:** -40% (illiquid private shares vs. public or near-exit
  assets)

**Combined Stage Discount:** ~90% (compounded effect of risk factors)

#### Valuation by Scenario

| Scenario        | Y3 ARR (GBP)    | Mature Value (6x) | Stage Discount    | Valuation (GBP) | Valuation (USD) |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Pessimistic** | £1.18M ($1.5M)  | £7.1M             | 90%               | **£0.7M**       | **$0.9M**       |
| **Realistic**   | £4.72M ($6.0M)  | £28.3M            | 90%               | **£2.8M**       | **$3.6M**       |
| **Optimistic**  | £7.87M ($10.0M) | £47.2M            | 85% (CLI premium) | **£7.1M**       | **$9.0M**       |

_Optimistic scenario applies 85% discount (vs. 90%) reflecting the
dual-interface premium — no competitor offers a CLI for agents alongside a GUI
for humans._

**Range:** Pessimistic £1.5M — £2.8M; Realistic £2.6M — £4.8M; Optimistic £3.5M
— £6.5M (applying +/-30%)

**Confidence Level:** LOW-MEDIUM. Deals are for mature companies with proven
revenue; stage discount introduces substantial estimation uncertainty. However,
the absence of any CLI-equipped social media SaaS in the comp set suggests
potential premium that this method cannot fully capture.

### 8. First Chicago Method

The First Chicago Method applies probability-weighted scenario analysis to
derive expected valuation, particularly suited for early-stage ventures with
wide outcome distributions. This method captures the asymmetric risk-return
profile of pre-revenue technology companies by modelling discrete futures rather
than extrapolating historical data. The three scenarios align directly with the
Pessimistic/Realistic/Optimistic framework used throughout this document.

#### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario               | Probability | Year 3 ARR | Year 5 Exit Multiple | Year 5 Value | Current Pre-Money     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| **Optimistic (Bull)**  | 30%         | $10M+      | 10-12x ARR           | $250-350M    | £5.0-7.5M ($6.4-9.5M) |
| **Realistic (Base)**   | 50%         | $5-7M      | 6-8x ARR             | $100-200M    | £2.5-4.0M ($3.2-5.1M) |
| **Pessimistic (Bear)** | 20%         | $1-2M      | Acqui-hire/IP        | $5-20M       | £0.5-1.5M ($0.6-1.9M) |

**Key Assumptions:**

- **Optimistic (Bull):** Product-market fit by Q3 2026, spike-cli creates viral
  developer funnel driving organic platform adoption, 15,000+ paid workspaces,
  successful Seed + Series A raises, MCP API becomes category-defining
- **Realistic (Base):** Moderate traction, 5,000-10,000 workspaces, SEIS seed
  round (£150-250K), spike-cli becomes established niche developer tool with
  steady npm downloads, competitive landscape manageable
- **Pessimistic (Bear):** Slow adoption, solo founder burnout, incumbents add AI
  features faster than expected, spike-cli gets no meaningful traction, pivot or
  acqui-hire scenario

#### Probability-Weighted Expected Value

| Scenario           | Midpoint (GBP) | x Probability | Weighted Value      |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Optimistic (Bull)  | £6.25M         | x 30%         | £1.88M              |
| Realistic (Base)   | £3.25M         | x 50%         | £1.63M              |
| Pessimistic (Bear) | £1.0M          | x 20%         | £0.20M              |
| **Expected Value** |                |               | **£3.70M ($4.70M)** |

#### Sensitivity to Probability Weights

| Bull Weight | Base Weight | Bear Weight | Expected Valuation (GBP) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 20%         | 50%         | 30%         | £2.88M ($3.66M)          |
| 30%         | 50%         | 20%         | £3.70M ($4.70M)          |
| 40%         | 40%         | 20%         | £4.10M ($5.21M)          |

The wide valuation range (£0.5M-7.5M) reflects inherent pre-revenue uncertainty,
while the 80% weighting toward Bull/Base cases acknowledges the founder's
technical execution, the dual-interface architecture (web dashboard +
spike-cli), SEIS/EIS tax advantages, and $20B+ TAM growth tailwinds. spike-cli's
contribution to the bull case is substantial: developer adoption creates
organic, low-CAC growth for the broader platform.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM. Captures outcome distribution well for early-stage
ventures. Scenario alignment across all eight methods improves internal
consistency.

### Weighted Calculation (Realistic Scenario)

| Method                  | Weight   | Midpoint (GBP) | Weighted Contribution |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Berkus                  | 20%      | £1.28M         | £0.26M                |

| Comparable Transactions | 5%       | £3.70M         | £0.19M                |
| **Weighted Average**    | **100%** |                | **£4.45M ($5.65M)**   |

### Recommended Pre-Money Valuation Range

|                                 | GBP    | USD    |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Floor (Berkus Pessimistic)**  | £0.9M  | $1.1M  |
| **Conservative**                | £3.5M  | $4.4M  |
| **Central Estimate**            | £4.5M  | $5.7M  |
| **Optimistic**                  | £5.5M  | $7.0M  |
| **Ceiling (Cost-to-Replicate)** | £11.0M | $14.0M |

**Recommended negotiating range for SEIS/seed round: £3.5M — £5.5M ($4.4M —
$7.0M) pre-money.**

This range balances:

- **Downward pressure** from pre-revenue status, solo founder risk, and unproven
  GTM
- **Upward pressure** from exceptional technical assets (953K LOC, 233 models,
  147 MCP tools, 46-file spike-cli), unique dual-interface architecture (GUI +
  CLI — no competitor has this), large addressable market ($20B+ TAM), and UK
  tax advantages (SEIS/EIS)

The £500K increase in the recommended range (from £3.0-5.0M to £3.5-5.5M) is
driven primarily by spike-cli's addition as a second product, the
cost-to-replicate increase (~£200-400K additional engineering value), and the
strategic premium of the dual-interface positioning.

## Disclaimers

1. **Forward-Looking Statements**: This analysis contains forward-looking
   projections based on management estimates and market research. Actual results
   may differ materially from projections due to market conditions, competitive
   dynamics, execution risk, and other factors. Three scenarios (Pessimistic,
   Realistic, Optimistic) are presented to capture the range of plausible
   outcomes.

2. **Pre-Revenue Stage**: SPIKE LAND LTD is a pre-revenue company. All revenue
   figures beyond Year 0 are projections, not historical data. Valuations of
   pre-revenue companies carry inherently higher uncertainty than those of
   revenue-generating businesses.

3. **Not Financial Advice**: This document is prepared for informational and
   internal planning purposes only. It does not constitute financial advice, an
   offer of securities, or a solicitation of investment. Recipients should
   consult qualified financial and legal advisors before making investment
   decisions.

4. **Methodology Limitations**: Each valuation method has known limitations,
   particularly at the pre-revenue stage. The weighted average approach
   mitigates individual method bias but does not eliminate estimation
   uncertainty. The three-scenario framework provides bounds but does not
   guarantee outcomes will fall within these ranges.

5. **Market Conditions**: Valuations are time-sensitive and reflect market
   conditions as of February 2026. Technology sector multiples, interest rates,
   and investor sentiment may change materially.

6. **Comparable Company Disclaimer**: Comparable company and transaction data is
   drawn from public sources and may not reflect exact terms, earnout
   structures, or non-disclosed conditions of referenced transactions. No
   comparable transaction involves a dual-interface (GUI + CLI) social media
   platform, limiting direct comparability.

7. **Currency Risk**: GBP/USD exchange rates fluctuate. The £1 = $1.27 rate used
   throughout is a point-in-time estimate and not guaranteed.
