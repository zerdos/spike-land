## Migration Status

### Done (~80% of IaC)

- Docker multi-stage builds (Next.js, Workerd, Hono API)
- Terraform modules for all core services
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions + Depot remote builds)
- OIDC federation (no long-lived AWS keys)
- ECS cluster definitions with auto-scaling (FARGATE_SPOT 75%)
- Aurora Global Database config (2 regions)
- ElastiCache Global Datastore config
- Rollback mechanism (ECS task definition versioning)
- VPC with 3 AZ, NAT gateways, VPC endpoints (ECR, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch)

### Blocked / In Progress

- Deploy success rate needs validation (smoke tests defined but untested
  end-to-end)
- ECR cross-region replication not formally configured in Terraform
- WAF not yet enabled (placeholder in CloudFront module)
- DNS cutover from Vercel/Cloudflare to Route 53 not started

### Not Started

- Route 53 DNS management
- CloudWatch alarms and dashboards
- X-Ray distributed tracing
- Secrets Manager (currently using SSM Parameter Store)
- Container Insights
- Cost Explorer budgets/alerts

### Key Insight for Discussion

AWS is more expensive than current serverless stack, but provides:

- Multi-region redundancy (us-east-1 + eu-west-1)
- No vendor lock-in (standard containers)
- Better observability (CloudWatch, X-Ray)
- Enterprise-grade database (Aurora Global)
- WebSocket-native architecture (NLB + Global Accelerator)

**Startup credits would significantly change the ROI equation.**

## What We Want From AWS

### 1. AWS Activate Program (Top Priority)

- UK startup, incorporated December 2025
- Solo founder, revenue-generating
- Significant AWS IaC already built (shows commitment)
- Looking for credits to offset migration cost differential
- Question: What tier are we eligible for? (Activate Founders vs Portfolio)

### 2. Solutions Architect Review

- Validate our multi-region architecture
- Global Accelerator vs CloudFront-only for WebSocket traffic
- Aurora Serverless v2 vs provisioned (our workload is bursty)
- NAT Gateway cost optimization (VPC endpoints already configured)
- Right-sizing Fargate tasks (currently conservative estimates)

### 3. Migration Assistance

- DNS cutover strategy (Vercel/Cloudflare --> Route 53)
- Zero-downtime database migration (Neon --> Aurora)
- Redis migration strategy (Upstash --> ElastiCache)
- Blue/green deployment patterns for ECS

### 4. Future Services of Interest

| Service          | Use Case                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bedrock**      | Unified AI provider (currently Claude API + Gemini directly) |
| **MediaConvert** | Video processing (we have Remotion workloads)                |
| **SES**          | Email delivery (currently using Resend)                      |
| **WAF**          | Already have placeholder in CloudFront config                |
| **Cognito**      | Potential auth consolidation (currently NextAuth v5)         |

## Questions to Ask Lennon

### Startup Support

1. Are we eligible for AWS Activate? (UK Ltd, Dec 2025, solo founder,
   revenue-generating)
2. What credits/support tiers are available for our stage?
3. Is there a Solutions Architect we can get assigned for architecture review?

### Technical Guidance

4. For bursty workloads, would you recommend Aurora Serverless v2 over
   provisioned db.r6g.large?
5. What's the recommended FARGATE vs FARGATE_SPOT ratio for production? (We have
   75% Spot)
6. Global Accelerator + NLB for WebSockets -- is this the right pattern, or is
   there a better approach?
7. NAT Gateways across 6 AZs (2 regions) are expensive -- any alternatives we
   should consider?

### Migration

8. Can AWS help with DNS cutover planning? (Vercel + Cloudflare --> Route 53 +
   CloudFront)
9. Is there a database migration service that works well for Neon PostgreSQL -->
   Aurora?
10. Any recommended approach for zero-downtime Redis migration?

### Cost

11. Any startup-specific pricing or reserved instance programs we should look
    at?
12. Are Savings Plans available for ECS Fargate at our scale?

| `deploy.yml`          | Push to main   | ~20-25 min (build + deploy 2 regions) |
| `terraform-apply.yml` | Push (infra/)  | ~5 min                                |
| `db-migrate.yml`      | Push (prisma/) | ~2 min                                |
