# Monorepo Onboarding

## Overview

This repo has two important layers:

- `src/**` is the source of truth
- `packages/*` contains deploy/publish shims and package entrypoints

That split matters a lot for the app store work:

- app-store runtime code lives in `src/edge-api/spike-land`
- first-party edge proxy code lives in `src/edge-api/main`
- frontend store UI lives in `src/frontend/platform-frontend`
- portable app logic and offline storage primitives live in `src/core/block-sdk`

The root workspace configuration is package-oriented, but the platform logic you
will actually read and edit mostly lives in `src/**`.

## Where To Look First

| Area | Source path | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App store MCP runtime | `src/edge-api/spike-land` | Public tools, auth, categories, store tool families |
| First-party edge API | `src/edge-api/main` | Public proxy routes, store tool catalog API, experiments |
| Frontend app store UI | `src/frontend/platform-frontend` | Store screens, app pages, install/discovery UX |
| Offline/runtime abstraction | `src/core/block-sdk` | D1/IndexedDB/memory storage portability |
| Deploy shims | `packages/*` | Wrangler and publish entrypoints |

## App Store Mental Model

Keep these rules in your head when working in this repo:

1. Every meaningful store action should have a tool surface.
2. Public discovery and authenticated execution are separate concerns.
3. Source changes go in `src/**`; deployment config changes usually go in
   `packages/*`.
4. Offline support is a real architecture path, not just a marketing claim.
5. The store is a platform surface, not only a frontend route.
