# Agent Orchestrator

The orchestrator demonstrates how to manage complex workflows by breaking them down into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks.

## 1. Create a Plan

Start by creating an execution plan with a set of dependencies.

<ToolRun name="orchestrator_create_plan" />

## 2. Dispatch Task

Once a plan is created, you can dispatch tasks to workers.

<ToolRun name="orchestrator_dispatch" />

## 3. Check Status

Monitor the progress of your overall plan.

<ToolRun name="orchestrator_status" />

## 4. Submit Result

Workers submit their results back to the orchestrator using the task ID.

<ToolRun name="orchestrator_submit_result" />

## 5. Merge

When all tasks are complete, merge the results into a final output.

<ToolRun name="orchestrator_merge" />
