# Principle 1: Requirements Are The Product

**Core idea:** The code is just the output. The requirement is the product.

## The Lesson

A developer joined a new team and asked Claude to help track analytics for a
retention offer. Claude generated code that called the Basket API to fetch
basket data. It looked perfect. It passed tests. The linter was happy.

The basket was server-side. The backend was the single source of truth. There
was no need to call the Basket API at all.

The PR was essentially garbage. The developer had no answer for why the code
existed -- because they did not write it. They approved it without
understanding.

**When AI hallucinates confidently, it makes you hallucinate too.**

## The Effort Split

| Activity | Time | Why                                                                    |
| -------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning | 30%  | Understanding the problem, planning interview, verifying understanding |
| Testing  | 50%  | Writing tests, running agent-based tests, verifying everything works   |
| Quality  | 20%  | Edge cases, maintainability, polish                                    |
| Coding   | ~0%  | AI writes the code; you make sure the code is right                    |

Notice what is missing. Coding. The actual typing of code takes almost no time.
The value is in understanding and verification.

## The Planning Interview (MCQ Verification)

This is the single biggest improvement. Before any code is written, the system
verifies the developer's understanding through multiple-choice questions across
six concepts: file awareness, test strategy, edge cases, dependency chains,
failure modes, and verification.

Unlike free-form Q&A where vague or hand-wavy answers pass undetected, MCQs
have a single correct answer. The system tracks mastery per concept (2+ correct
across different question variants) and detects contradictions (previously
correct answers later contradicted).

**Stopping rules:**
- Score below 50% on any round: stop and research.
- 3+ contradictions: stop and review the codebase.
- All 6 concepts mastered: proceed to implementation.

If the MCQ system had been in place for the basket PR, the developer would have
failed the "dependency chain" and "file awareness" concepts — because they did
not know what data already existed on the server or which files were relevant.

## Actionable Takeaways

1. Write requirements like you mean it -- clear acceptance criteria, edge cases,
   examples.
2. Have the AI interview you before any code is written.
3. If you cannot explain the problem in your own words, you are not ready for
   implementation.
4. If coding agents make mistakes, the requirements were not specified well
   enough.
5. Multiply zero understanding by a powerful AI and you still get zero.

## Spike Land in Practice

**Store's `StoreApp` interface as requirements-as-code.** The
`src/app/store/data/store-apps.ts` file defines 23 apps with typed interfaces
(`StoreApp`) that serve as executable requirements. Each app declares its
`toolCount`, `mcpTools[]`, `features[]`, and `category` — making the requirement
the literal source of truth. When an app claims 21 tools, the typed array
enforces it.

**FEATURES.md drift as a warning sign.** In January 2026, FEATURES.md documented
only "Pixel" and "Vibe Coding" as supporting tools — while the codebase had
grown to 23 store apps with 163 MCP tools. This drift meant agents reading the
docs got a fundamentally wrong picture of the platform. The requirement (docs)
no longer matched the product (code), violating Principle 1 directly.

**The planning interview catches architecture mistakes.** When building the
Chess Arena (21 MCP tools), question 2 ("What data already exists?") revealed
that the chess engine, ELO calculations, and game state all needed to live in
`src/lib/chess/` as pure business logic — not embedded in MCP tool handlers.
This separation produced 6 clean library files that any tool layer can consume.
